Credit Risk Analysis Report Explained

The main goal of this repository and its analysis is to assess a logistic regression model specifically geared towards lending data. The model is binary in the sense that credit liability correlates with loan applications, distinguishing them as either healthy loans (0) or high-risk loans (1). Generally speaking, financial institutions aim to mitigate risk as much as possible--where the risk is worth the reward versus the market or their competitors. This seemingly simple binary model can make these organizations efficient and profitable in their lending practices. 

Here are some key indicators/figures from our LRM:

Accuracy: Measures the overall precision of the model across the pair (binary) of outcomes. Accuracy is determined by the percentage of predicted observations to the total observations. 
Precision: States the model's accuracy in predicting healthy loans. It indicates the portion or percentage of positive predictions for the healthy loan class, similarly, high-risk loans follows the same calculation process giving you a ratio/percentage of previously stated predictions. 
Recall: Computes the model's capability to capture all authentic, healthy loans. It's the ratio of correctly predicted healthy loans to all actual healthy loans. Recall for High-risk loans follow this measurement. 
Results and Conclusion: The logistic regression model demonstrates promising results in credit risk prediction. 

The model shows a balanced accuracy score, suggesting successful performance in differentiating between healthy and high-risk loans.
When using oversampled data, precision and recall scores were improved, therefore the model promises to be both reliable and capable of identifying high-risk loans without missclassification. 
Based on this model and the ensuing results, it is advised & encouraged for use by financial institutions in its loan approval process. The unique ability to precicely predict high-risk loans will reduce the risk of default, leading to higher revenue and efficiency in this process.
